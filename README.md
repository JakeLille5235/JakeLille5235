- 👋 Hi, I’m @JakeLille5235 (Jake Lille). I am currently a student at the Universtiy of Central Florda, pursing a Computer Science and Marketing double major, with a minor in Statistics.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning, driven by my hyper-curiousity and desire to problem solve. Passions include reading, running (tri-athlete), playing/creating music (guitar) and traveling!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer science fundamentals, utilizing C and JavaScript (via. The Odin Project). Determining whether to take the full-stack route or more back-end focus.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on practical projects that solve a niche! Bonus points if it's relavent to music.
