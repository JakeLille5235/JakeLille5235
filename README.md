- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JakeLille5235 (Jake Lille). I am a UCF alumni with passion and interest in all things tech. I graduated with a Marketing and Statistics focused degree, however, am in process of obtaining my cybersecurity certifications and completing independent projects. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning, driven by my hyper-curiousity and desire to problem solve. Passions include reading, running (tri-athlete), playing/creating music (guitar) and traveling!
